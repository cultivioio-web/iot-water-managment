## 5. 🟠 OPTIONAL: Patent Protection

### What Could Be Patented

| Invention | Patentability | Cost-Benefit |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Zigbee water level protocol | Maybe | Low (not unique enough) |
| Unified firmware concept | No | Not patentable |
| Specific algorithm | Maybe | Medium |
| Hardware design | Maybe | Low |

### Reality Check

```
Patents are:
├── Expensive: ₹50,000 - 5,00,000
├── Slow: 3-5 years to grant
├── Hard to enforce: Legal costs ₹10-50 lakh
└── Limited: India only (global = 10x cost)

For a startup, patents are usually NOT worth it.
Better to:
├── Move fast (first mover advantage)
├── Build brand (trademark)
├── Create ecosystem (hard to replicate)
└── Keep innovating (stay ahead)
```

### If You Still Want Patent

```
Step 1: Provisional Patent (₹1,600 for startup)
        - Basic protection for 12 months
        - Time to validate market

Step 2: Complete Specification (within 12 months)
        - Full patent application
        - ₹4,000-8,000 filing fee

Step 3: Examination Request
        - ₹4,000 fee
        - Wait 1-3 years

Step 4: Grant
        - Annual renewal fees
```

| Supplier contacts & prices | NDA with employees |

| Pricing algorithms | Confidential |
| Future roadmap | Need-to-know basis |
