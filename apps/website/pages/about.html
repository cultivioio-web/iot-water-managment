                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>At Cultivio, we believe technology should solve real problems in everyday life. Our mission is to bring intelligent automation to Indian homes, starting with water management – a challenge faced by millions of families every day.</p>
                <p>We're building products that are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Simple:</strong> Easy to install and use, no technical expertise needed</li>
                    <li><strong>Affordable:</strong> Quality solutions at prices that make sense for Indian families</li>
                    <li><strong>Reliable:</strong> Works without internet, designed for Indian conditions</li>
                    <li><strong>Local:</strong> Made in India, for India</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Cultivio was born from a simple frustration – watching water overflow from tanks while pumps run unnecessarily. We saw this problem in homes across India: wasted water, higher electricity bills, damaged property from overflows, and the constant worry of empty tanks.</p>
                <p>Existing solutions were either too expensive, too complicated, or required constant internet connectivity. We set out to build something different – a smart water management system that just works.</p>
                <p>AquaSense is our first product, and it represents everything we stand for: solving real problems with simple, affordable, and reliable technology.</p>
